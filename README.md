# Database-Java-Project

This project demonstrates the integration of a Java application with a PostgreSQL database. The application interacts with the database using JDBC to perform operations such as data insertion, retrieval, and manipulation. The database was also populated using pgAdmin and SQL scripts.

## Features
- **Database Integration:** Connects to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC.
- **Data Population:**
  - Via SQL scripts using pgAdmin.
  - Dynamically through the Java application using JDBC.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
